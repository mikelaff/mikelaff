#### Code Samples
The data analysis surrounding my latest publication can be found [here](https://github.com/mikelaff/mirna-eqtl-manuscript). Most of this analysis was done using R and BASH.

The majority of my experience with Python has been with class projects (as a student and as a TA). A good example was an introductory programming course I designed and taught with a colleague, which can be found [here](https://github.com/snystrom/UNC-HTLC_Python_2017).
