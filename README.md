## Hi there 👋, I'm Mike!
#### Computational Biologist | Gamer | Dog Lover

My name is Mike, and I'm a graduate from the University of North Carolina with a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I am currently working as a postdoc in the [Stein Lab](https://www.steinlab.org) and looking for the next step in my career! He/Him 🧬👨🏻‍💻🏳️‍🌈

#### Code Samples
My lab uses Bitbucket for all our project repositories, so must of my code resides there. The data analysis surrounding my latest publication can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/steinlabunc/mirna-eqtl/src/master/). Most of this analysis was done using R and BASH. A good example of a pipeline can be found in this specific [folder](https://bitbucket.org/steinlabunc/mirna-eqtl/src/master/src/conditionally_independent_eqtls/).  

The majority of my experience with Python has been with class projects (as a student and as a TA). A good example was an introductory programming course I designed and taught with a colleague, which can be found [here](https://github.com/snystrom/UNC-HTLC_Python_2017).
